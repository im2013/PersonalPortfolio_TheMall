        <h2>Player Movement, Raycasting and Backpacks</h2>
                    <h3>20-06-2024</h3>
                    <p>Today I decided to focus on making sure player movement was fully working, I spent a few days ago (~13th) doing 
                        player walking and camera movement. I finalised this by tweaking some camera variables such as FOV and finalising some code.
                        After this, I proceeded to work on Raycasting.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>(15:30) I decided to work on a very basic backpack, to later be used for inventory. It works by using two empty positions a backpack can travel 
                        betweenst, a "in front of player" position, and a "on back" position, it works by moving the backpack between the two positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Opening and closing the backpack:</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>(18:55) Raycasting is the process of shooting a 'ray' from a point of origin, outwards in a specific direction.</p>
                    <p>I've used raycasting here for the player to be able to see what they are looking at. It works by shooting a ray out of the camera
                         which then bounces forwards, hitting the collider of an object of a specific category, and returns the object at the ray's hit point.
                    </p>
                    <p>Early raycasting:</p>

                    <p>Demonstration of final raycasting:</p>

                    <p>(21:00) After this, I've began implementing the player removing the backpack, later I'll add the ability to pick it back up. This unfortunately 
                        took me a while, as I had difficult bugs to deal with- relating to how Child-Parent of objects work.

                    <br>
                    <p>To conclude today's programming, I spent from 15:30 till 21:50 coding (6.2hrs) and used: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
                        <li>OBS (recording clips)</li>
                    </ul>
